# Smart Edge Topology

**Smart Edge Topology** is a lightweight Python toolkit for defining and working with network topologies in edge computing environments.

Edge computing systems often consist of many distributed nodes — sensors, compute units, gateways, and edge servers — connected in complex ways. This project provides a simple foundation to represent, generate, and analyze such topologies as structured network graphs.

## 🚀 Features

- 📍 Define edge nodes and their connections in code
- 📊 Generate configurable topologies for simulation or analysis
- 🔄 Support for extending topology definitions
- 🧪 Ideal for experimenting with edge network layouts and planning

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Edge computing deployments — especially in IoT, 5G, and distributed cloud scenarios — require careful planning of how devices communicate and coordinate. With Smart Edge Topology, you can:

- Visualize edge networks before deployment
- Prototype topology configurations
- Run experiments on network layout ideas
